# Output Parsers

Language models output text. But many times you may want to get more structured information than just text back. This is where output parsers come in.

Output parsers are classes that help structure language model responses. There are two main methods an output parser must implement:

- `getFormatInstructions(): str` A method which returns a string containing instructions for how the output of a language model should be formatted.
- `parse(raw: string): any` A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and parses it into some structure.

Below we go over some examples of output parsers.

## Structured Output Parser

This output parser can be used when you want to return multiple fields.

import Structured from "@examples/prompts/structured_parser.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Structured}</CodeBlock>

## Structured Output Parser with Zod Schema

This output parser can be also be used when you want to define the output schema using Zod, a TypeScript validation library.

import StructuredZod from "@examples/prompts/structured_parser_zod.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StructuredZod}</CodeBlock>

## Comma-separated List Parser

This output parser can be used when you want to return a list of items.

import Comma from "@examples/prompts/comma_list_parser.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Comma}</CodeBlock>
